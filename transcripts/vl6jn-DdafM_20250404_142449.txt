[00:02] - [Narrator] 50 years ago we
pioneered a path to the moon.
[00:06] The trail we blazed cut through
the fictions of science,
[00:09] and showed us all what was possible.
[00:14] Today our calling to
explore is even greater.
[00:18] To go farther, we must be
able to sustain missions
[00:21] of greater distance and duration.
[00:23] We must use the resources
we find at our destinations,
[00:27] we must overcome radiation,
isolation, gravity,
[00:33] and extreme environments
like never before.
[00:36] These are the challenges we face
[00:38] to push the bounds of humanity.
[00:41] We're going to the moon to stay, by 2024.
[00:46] And this is how.
[00:48] - This all starts with
the ability to get larger,
[00:51] heavier payloads off planet,
and beyond Earth's gravity.
[00:55] - For this, we designed
an entirely new rocket.
[00:58] - The Space Launch System.
[01:00] SLS will be the most powerful
rocket ever developed.
[01:03] - [Female] And with
components and production
[01:04] - And more in testing,
[01:06] - This system is capable
of being the catalyst
[01:08] for deep space missions.
[01:10] - [Female] We need a capsule
that can support humans
[01:13] from launch, through deep space,
[01:15] and return safely back to earth.
[01:18] - For this, we've built Orion.
[01:21] - This is NASA's next
generation human space capsule.
[01:25] - Using data from lunar orbiters
[01:27] that continue to reveal the
moon's hazards and resources,
[01:30] we're currently developing
an entirely new approach
[01:33] to landing and operating on the moon.
[01:35] - Using our commercial partners
[01:37] to deliver science instruments
and robotics to the surface,
[01:40] we are paving the way for
human missions in 2024.
[01:44] - [Narrator] Our charge is
to go quickly, and stay.
[01:47] To press our collective efforts forward,
[01:50] with a fervor that will
see us return to the moon
[01:53] in a manner that is wholly
different than 50 years ago.
[01:57] - We want lunar lander's
that are reusable,
[02:00] that can land anywhere
on the lunar surface.
[02:02] The simplest way to do so
is to give them a platform,
[02:05] in orbit, around the moon,
from which to transition.
[02:08] - An orbiting platform to
host deep space experiments,
[02:11] and be a way-point for human capsules.
[02:13] We call this lunar outpost, Gateway.
[02:16] - [Female] The beauty of the Gateway
[02:17] is that it can be moved between orbits.
[02:20] - [Male Narrator] It will balance
[02:20] between the earth and moon's gravity,
[02:22] [Female Narrator] In a position
that is ideal for launching
[02:24] even deeper space missions.
[02:27] - In 2009, we learned that the moon
[02:29] contains millions of tons of water ice.
[02:32] - This ice could be extracted
and purified for water,
[02:35] and be separated into
oxygen for breathing,
[02:36] or hydrogen for rocket fuel.
[02:38] - The moon is quite uniquely suited
[02:40] to prepare us and propel
us to Mars and beyond.
[02:46] - This is what we're building.
[02:47] - This is what we're training for.
[02:49] - This we can replicate
throughout the solar system.
[02:52] - This is the next chapter
of human space exploration.
[02:56] - [Narrator] Humans are
the most fragile element
[02:58] of this entire endeavor,
[02:59] and yet we go for humanity.
[03:02] They go to the moon and on
to Mars to seek knowledge
[03:05] and understanding,
[03:06] and to share it with all.
[03:08] We go knowing our efforts
will create opportunities
[03:11] that cannot be foreseen.
[03:13] We go because we are destined to explore
[03:15] and see it with our own eyes.
[03:17] We turn towards the moon now,
[03:19] not as a conclusion, but as preparation.
[03:23] As a checkpoint toward
all that lies beyond.
[03:26] Our greatest adventures
remain ahead of us.
[03:29] We are going.
[03:31] - We're going.
[03:32] - We are going.
[03:34] [Rocket engine blast]
[03:35] - We are going.
[03:38] - We're going.
